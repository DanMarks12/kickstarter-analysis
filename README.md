# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Campaigns launched in June and May were more succesful
Campaigns launched in January July and December had a much greater chance of failure

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaigns with more realistic Goals have a higher chance of being succesful. The higher the goal does not mean a more succesful Campaign

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
First off THE 'mi8' RISES | The Best Wireless Duo Stereo Sound System should be removed because it is a huge outlier (had a $1 goal) 

Also there is limited amount of data from 2009-2012 (around 500) compared to recent 4 years (3.3k+), skews any historical trends to be based on more recent findings
We could also find data outside of kickstarter and compare our findings (such as Indigogo) maybe plays/theatre were more succseful on different crowdfunding websites

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could provide analysis on if # of backers affects the succes of a campaign
We could provide analysis on country by country. Louise is set on USA/UK but maybe there are better options out there we are not looking at
